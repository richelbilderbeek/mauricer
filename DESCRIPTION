Description: 'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated 
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2' (<http://www.beast2.org>),
  which, among others, allows one to install BEAST2 package. 
  The mauricer package allows to install BEAST2 packages from R.
