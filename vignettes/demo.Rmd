```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


```{r}
library(mauricer)
library(testthat)
```

List all BEAST2 packages:

```{r}
beast2_packages <- list_beast2_packages() 
knitr::kable(head(beast2_packages))
```

Find a package that is not installed:

```{r}
first_absent_package_name <- beast2_packages[ 
  beast2_packages$installed_version == "NA", 
]$name[1]
print(first_absent_package_name)
```

Install that package:

```{r}
install_beast2_package(first_absent_package_name)
```

Should not be the first absent package anymore:

```{r}
beast2_packages <- list_beast2_packages() 
new_first_absent_package_name <- beast2_packages[ 
  beast2_packages$installed_version == "NA", 
]$name[1]
expect_true(new_first_absent_package_name != first_absent_package_name)
```

Uninstall that package:

```{r}
uninstall_beast2_package(first_absent_package_name)
```

Should be the first absent package again:

```{r}
beast2_packages <- list_beast2_packages() 
last_first_absent_package_name <- beast2_packages[ 
  beast2_packages$installed_version == "NA", 
]$name[1]
expect_true(last_first_absent_package_name == first_absent_package_name)
```
